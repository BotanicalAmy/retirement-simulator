# Welcome to my Retirement Simulator Application

The retirement simulator app was inspired by an Excel based retirement income planner, created for my personal use. A local wealth management firm had a business use case
to have a data science application capable of visualizing various retirement options. Specifically, the financial planners benefited from a retirement simulation
model that visualized the effect of nervous investors, those who pull out of the stock market during a down year.

As an analyst and math enthusiast, I enjoyed applying sequences and probability theory into the methods used for this data application. I have a passion for integrating my
experience in front end development and UX design into data science applications. Math is the language of problem solving,  and my creative and artistic skills serve as a 
transator for analytical methods.

I hope you enjoyed this project. For developers hoping to learn more, visit my website for tips on how to get started with Streamlit.
