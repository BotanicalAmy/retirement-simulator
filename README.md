# Welcome to my Retirement Simulator Application

The retirement simulator app was inspired by an Excel-based retirement income planner created for my personal use. A local wealth management firm had a business use case to have a data science application capable of visualizing various retirement options. Specifically, the financial planners benefited from a retirement simulation model that visualized the effect of nervous investors, those who pull out of the stock market during a down year.

As an analyst and math enthusiast, I enjoyed applying sequences and probability theory to the methods used for this data application. For this particular project, I enjoyed integrating my experience in front-end development and UX design to create an interactive data solution for retirement planning. Math is the language of problem solving and art is the creative tool for bringing analytical solutions into action.

I hope you enjoyed this project. For developers hoping to learn more, visit my website for tips on how to [get started with Streamlit](https://denverdatadesign.com/ai_retirement_simulator/).
